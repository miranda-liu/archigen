ArchiGen gives users the power to specify what general features they need in an architectural floor plan (e.g, number of rooms, type of building) and generates multiple potential layouts that meet the constraints.

Hence, our product breaks the bounds of creativity by considering arrangements that would not immediately have been thought of by the human mind.

Stable diffusion template used to train the model we used to generate floorplans can be found [here](https://github.com/Excalibro1/fast-stable-diffusionwik/wiki/fast-stable-diffusion-wiki).

Floor plan dataset used and tools for conversion between several graph & image representations of dataset components can be found [here](https://github.com/unaisaralegui/rplanpy).
